# Background

On April 3, 2024 the EEA Community Projects Managed Open Project  was re-named to Ethereum OASIS Open Project.

This resulted in a series of changes to the assets of the project, particularly the existing store of i-CLA signatures collected by the CLA Assistant. Chet Ensign and Claudia Rausch saved background information to retain a snapshot of the project assets prior to the transition. 

This repository is intended to a place to collect this historical data or links to external artifacts.
